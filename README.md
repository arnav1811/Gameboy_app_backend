## 🛠️ Tech Behind the Magic

| **Layer**           | **Stack**                                                                                         | **Description** |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Frontend**         | `Flutter` (Android, Web, iOS) + Custom GameBoy UI                                                 | Built with Flutter for true cross-platform support. The GameBoy interface is fully recreated with custom widgets, retro typography, D-pad controls, and smooth animations. |
| **Backend**          | `Node.js` + `Express.js`                                                                          | Handles user authentication, profile management, image uploads, and match logic. Cleanly structured with RESTful APIs. |
| **Auth & Database**  | `Supabase` (PostgreSQL + JWT Auth)                                                                | Supabase provides scalable authentication and database services. Stores user profiles, image URLs, and matches, all secured with JWT tokens. |
| **Image Pixelation** | `sharp` (Node.js image processing library)                                                        | Converts uploaded profile photos into pixelated retro-style images with reduced resolution and a strict 8-color RGB palette. Uses nearest-neighbor scaling to maintain crisp pixels. |
| **Hosting & Deployment** | `Railway` (backend server), `Supabase` (database & file storage) | The backend is deployed on Railway. Supabase handles real-time database and file storage. |
